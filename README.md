## Machine Learning University: Decision Trees and Ensemble Methods Class

This repository contains __slides__, __notebooks__, and __datasets__ for the __Machine Learning University (MLU) Decision Trees and Ensemble Methods__ class. Our mission is to make Machine Learning accessible to everyone. We have courses available across many topics of machine learning and believe knowledge of ML can be a key enabler for success. This class is designed to help you get started with tree based models, learn about widely used Machine Learning techniques and apply them to real-world problems.

## Course Overview
There are five lectures, one final project and five assignments for this class.
| Lecture 1 | Lecture 2 | Lecture 3 | Lecture 4 | Lecture 5 |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Decision Trees | Bias-variance trade-off | Bootstrapping | Random Forest Proximities | Boosting |
| Impurity Functions | Error Decomposition | Bagging | Some use cases for Proximities | Gradient Boosting |
| CART Algorithm | Extra Trees Algorithm | Random Forests | Feature Importance in Trees | XGBoost, LightGBM and CatBoost |
| Regularization | Bias-variance and Randomized Ensembles |  | Feature Importance in Random Forests |  |

__Final Project:__ Practice working with a "real-world" computer vision dataset for the final project. Final project dataset is in the [data/final_project folder](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-machine-learning-university-dte/tree/main/data/final_project). For more details on the final project, check out [this notebook](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-machine-learning-university-dte/blob/main/notebooks/final_project/DTE-FINAL-PROJECT.ipynb).
